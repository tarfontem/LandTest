Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1

instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print
"Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz
" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz"

out a significant percentage of programmer candidates. So if you solved

/*
Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using
newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there
is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a
chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding
size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size,
outputting a grid of the given width and height.
